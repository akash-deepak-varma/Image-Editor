# Computer Vision Image Processing Project

## Overview

This project implements various computer vision functionalities designed to manipulate and enhance images. The project includes the following features:

1. **Color Palette Extraction**
2. **Background Color Changer**
3. **Foreground and Background Separator with Background Changer**
4. **Image Resolution Enhancer**
5. **Background Focus (Bokeh) and Foreground Focus**
6. **Watermark Removal**

Each of these features leverages computer vision and image processing techniques to either improve, modify, or analyze images in innovative ways.
